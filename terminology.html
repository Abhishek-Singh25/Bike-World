    <div class="content" id="c1">
        <p>
            The Motorcycle Traction Control System is a safey feature designed to prevent the rear wheel from slipping or spinning out of
            control during acceleration.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Purpose:</strong> Traction control ensures stability by managing the power delivered to the rear wheel, especially in
            situations where traction might be compromised (e.g., wet roads, gravel, or aggressive acceleration).
        </p>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>Reactive Traction Control:</strong> In this type, the system waits until the wheel starts spinning and then makes
                corrections. Various components work together to prevent drifting.</li><br>
                <li><strong>Predictive Traction Control:</strong> Here, the Electronic Control Unit (ECU) and sensors continuously monitor
                data in real-time. They make adjustments before the wheel spins, effectively preventing drift. This type is faster and more
                efficient.</li>
            </ul>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>Bank Angle Sensor:</strong> Measures the motorcycle's lean angle.</li>
                <li><strong>Gyroscope:</strong> Detects changes in orientation.</li>
                <li><strong>Throttle Position Sensor:</strong> Monitors throttle position.</li>
                <li><strong>Gear Position Sensor:</strong> Determines the gear engaged.</li>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>ECU Processing:</strong> Modern ECUs process data from various sensors (including gravitational forces and lean
                angles) within milliseconds.</li><br>
                <li><strong>Power Control:</strong> The system adjusts power delivery to the rear wheel. It can:</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Stop fuel supply to the engine, causing misfires.</li>
                    <li>Use ride-by-wire technology to electronically adjust throttle position, limiting power even during aggressive revving.</li>
                </ul><br>
                <li><strong>Pre-configured riding modes:</strong> Some motorcycles offers different riding modes that limit throttle response
                based on road conditions and rider preferences.</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
            In summary, motorcycle traction control enhances safety by preventing wheel spin and maintaining stability, especially in challenging
            riding conditions.

        <div class="content" id="c2" style="height: 200px;">
            <p>
                ABS (Anti-lock Braking System) is a safety feature that is designed to prevent the wheels of a motorcycle from locking up
                during hard braking.
            </p>
            <p>
                ABS detects that a wheel is about to lock up, it automatically modulates the brake pressure to that wheel, allowing it to
                continue rotating and maintaining traction on the road. This helps the rider to stop more quickly and safely, while also
                providing stability and control during braking.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>How it works:</strong> The wheel speed sensor constantly monitors the rotation of the wheel & sends a signal to
                the ECU if it detects a wheel lock up. <br>
                ABS operates by repeatedly releasing & reapplying brake force until the wheel gains traction. It all happens within milliseconds.

            <p>
                <h3 style="text-align: center;">Slipper Clutch</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>In regular clutch, when you pull the clutch lever, the inner hub (connected to the rear wheel via the gearbox) disengages from
                    crankshaft input, allowing the rear wheel to rotate freely.
                    </li><br>
                    <li>However, if you downshift aggressively while the engine is near the redline, the rear wheel speed might be too high.
                        This could lead to rear wheel lockup, skidding, or even a crash.
                    </li><br>
                    <li>The Slipper clutch prevents this by allowing the clutch to slip temporarily until the engine speed & rear wheel speed
                        match properly again.
                    </li><br>
                    <li>
                        A slipper clutch assembly has ramps built into the inner basket as well as the pressure plate. These ramps have the ability 
                        to allow for a sliding or slipping motion in the direction of the rotation of the wheel. Now, with this kind of an arrangement, 
                        under heavy deceleration caused by a sloppy downshift, the rear wheel won't be able to over rev the engine. Instead, the ramps 
                        designed within the basket and the pressure plate would slide, or slip over each other, pushing the pressure plate away from the 
                        clutch, release the frictional pressure that keeps the clutch pack together, thus allowing for a limited free movement of the rear 
                        wheel and avoiding engine over-revving, rear wheel locking. This 'slipping' function within the clutch assembly allows a rider 
                        to downshift more aggressively.

                <h3 style="text-align: center;">Assist Clutch</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        One issue that a lot of riders face, especially with higher capacity motorcycles which have a powerful spring pulling the pressure plate 
                        in, is that it requires a lot of force. The clutch lever in such cases is very stiff, and the rider has to use a lot of force.
                    </li><br>
                    <li>
                        A solution that automotive engineers have come up with is the 'Assist' clutch, which is also known as a 'slip and grip' clutch and works 
                        very well in tandem with a slipper clutch. Slipper clutch has ramps, which only allow slippage of the pressure plate and basket as the bike 
                        decelerates aggressively. It, however, doesn't have any modifications made to the assembly for the time when the bike accelerates. In the case 
                        of Assist Clutch, there are reverse ramps too, which lock in, and pull the pressure plate in as the bike accelerates. Now, since the accelerating 
                        force of the bike itself is helping pull the pressure plate in, increasing friction between the plates, the goal of using lesser, or lighter springs 
                        could be achieved. As a result, a lesser force is required to be applied by the rider at the clutch lever.

                A Quickshifter is a device that allows a motorcycle rider to shift gears without using the clutch or letting off the throttle. <br><br>
                <strong>How it works:</strong>
                <ol>
                    <li>The rider applies pressure to the gear lever to shift up or down.</li>
                    <li>The Quickshifter detects this movement & sends a signal to the engine control unit (ECU).</li>
                    <li>The ECU momentarily cuts off the ignition or fuel supply to the engine.</li>
                    <li>This interruption in power unloads the transmission, reducing the load on the drivetrain.</li>
                    <li>The reduced load allows the gear to shift smoothly without needing to use the clutch or let off the throttle.</li>
                    <li>Once the gear change is complete, the ignition or fuel supply is restored & power is smoothly transferred back to the engine.</li>
